This is a demo project for my market based governance system.  I've chosen Archetype for now, since it's much less offensive than the EVM and I feel strongly that Tezos will survive as a project.

If there's demand, someone else can port it to the EVM.  I'm too old for that kind of shit.

For the basic ideas behind the system, see the one_pager.md document.

Status: Embryonic, and I'm learning Archetype as I go.  I haven't even decided on a testing framework (no, I don't do TDD; sue me).
